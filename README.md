# TUC Aid — Tucson Water & Help Chain

## Overview

TUC Aid is a decentralized community help platform designed for Tucson, Arizona. It incentivizes mutual aid and water conservation by rewarding participants with TUC tokens, a local utility token redeemable for goods and services such as cannabis discounts, food bundles, and handyman help.

The project combines a clean, mobile-friendly frontend with a flexible backend, designed for easy deployment on platforms like GitHub Pages and Xano. It aims to foster community resilience and sustainable water use in the Sonoran Desert.
